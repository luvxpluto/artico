**Key Features:**

**Local Currency Checkout:** Customers can pay in their preferred currency.

You can customize currency format by displaying **country flags**, currency symbol, currency code, or both. It's easy to display the currency switcher anywhere using [yaycurrency-switcher] shortcode. The pricing can be customized using correct formatting for thousand separator, decimal separator, spacing, and rounding.

**WooCommerce Sales Reports**
Visit WooCommerce > Reports > Orders, and you can view your store performance based on currency. Once filtered, you will easily see your total sales, leaderboards, orders, and top products sold in each currency. 

**Pretty Price Ending** 
Round the converted prices to your desired threshold and make them end in target figures (such as 00, .49, .79, .99, and so on). Psychological pricing made easy with YayCurrency. You can run live test calculations to be sure you'll have the right WooCommerce multi currency outcome.

**Manage Conversion Fee**
For each currency pair, your bank, payment processor, or money transfer operator may apply a currency exchange fee. To reduce cash loss, you can optionally add a conversion fee to WooCommerce multi currency settings.

**Multiple Currency Switcher Widgets**
Display the WooCommerce multi currency switcher at your store's optimal point using the widget customizer and shortcode. 
Even when you’re already using various widgets of chatbox, contact button, or other theme widgets, you still can find a sweet spot for the currency converter.
